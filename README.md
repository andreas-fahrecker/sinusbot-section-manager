Sinusbot-Section-Manager
=

A simple scection manager script.
Its not very complicated, you just select a channel as the section channel, then you can configure the setting for the subchannels, you can even configure the permission for the channel.
Then the bot makes sure that there is always one empty channel in your section.

To develop on this extension you have to start the dev-compose environment and then each time you modified the script you have to run the de-deploy script
